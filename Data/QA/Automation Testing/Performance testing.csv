What is Performance Testing?,Performance Testing is a type of software testing which ensures that the application is performing well under the workload. The goal of performance testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks. It measures the quality attributes of the system. 
What are the different types of Performance Testing?,"Load testing – It checks the application’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live.
Stress testing – This involves testing an application under extreme workloads to see how it handles high traffic or data processing. The objective is to identify the breaking point of an application.
Endurance testing – It is done to make sure the software can handle the expected load over a long period of time.
Spike testing – This tests the software’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.
Volume testing – Under Volume Testing large no. of. Data is populated in a database and the overall software system’s behavior is monitored.
Scalability testing – The objective of scalability testing is to determine the software application’s effectiveness in scaling up to support an increase in user load."
What are the common performance problems faced by users?,"Some of the common performance problems faced by users are:
Longer loading time
Poor response time
Poor Scalability
Bottlenecking such as coding errors or hardware issues"
Name some of the common Performance Testing Tools.,"The market is full of a number of tools for test management, performance testing, GUI testing, functional testing, etc. I would suggest you opt for a tool which is on-demand, easy to learn as per your skills, generic and effective for the required type of testing. Some of the common Performance Testing tools are:
LoadView
Apache JMeter
LoadUI Pro
WebLoad
NeoLoad"
List out some common Performance bottlenecks.,"Some common performance bottlenecks include:
CPU Utilization
Memory Utilization
Networking Utilization
S limitation
Disk Usage"
What are the Parameters considered for Performance Testing?,"The Parameters for Performance Testing are:
Memory usage
Processor usage
Bandwidth
Memory pages
Network output queue length
Response time
CPU interruption per second
Committed memory
Thread counts
Top waits"
What is throughput in Performance Testing?,"Throughput is referred to the amount of data transported to the server in responds to the client request at a given period of time. It is calculated in terms of requests per second, calls per day, reports per year, hits per second, etc. Performance of application depends on throughput value, higher the value of throughput -higher the performance of the application."
What is Endurance Testing & Spike Testing?,"Endurance Testing – It is a type of performance testing where the testing is conducted to evaluate the behavior of the system when a significant workload is given continuously.
Spike Testing – It is a type of performance testing that is performed to analyze the behavior of the system when the load is increased substantially."
What are the different phases for automated Performance Testing?,"Design or Planning
Build
Execution
Analyzing & Tuning"
What is a Protocol? Name some Protocols.,"A protocol is a defined as a set of various rules for the purpose of information communication between the two or more systems.
Some of the Protocols are :
HTTP
HTTPS
FTP
Web Services
Citrix"
What is a Performance Tuning?,"Performance tuning is the improvement of system performance. Typically in computer systems, the motivation for such activity is called a performance problem. It can be either real or anticipated and most systems will respond to increased load with some degree of decreasing performance."
