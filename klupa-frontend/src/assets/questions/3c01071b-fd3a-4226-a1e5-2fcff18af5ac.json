[{"question":"What is Performance Testing?","answer":"Performance Testing is a type of software testing which ensures that the application is performing well under the workload. The goal of performance testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks. It measures the quality attributes of the system.

The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live.\r\nStress testing – This involves testing an application under extreme workloads to see how it handles high traffic or data processing. The objective is to identify the breaking point of an application.\r\nEndurance testing – It is done to make sure the software can handle the expected load over a long period of time.\r\nSpike testing – This tests the software’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.\r\nVolume testing – Under Volume Testing large no. of. Data is populated in a database and the overall software system’s behavior is monitored.\r\nScalability testing – The objective of scalability testing is to determine the software application’s effectiveness in scaling up to support an increase in user load.","id":"83a6d0be-fb70-4f22-9390-57edc755dd24","categoryId":"3c01071b-fd3a-4226-a1e5-2fcff18af5ac"},{"question":"What are the common performance problems faced by users?","answer":"Some of the common performance problems faced by users are:\r\nLonger loading time\r\nPoor response time\r\nPoor Scalability\r\nBottlenecking such as coding errors or hardware issues","id":"d64c1b30-a99e-4f8a-923f-4a3def771f2e","categoryId":"3c01071b-fd3a-4226-a1e5-2fcff18af5ac"},{"question":"Name some of the common Performance Testing Tools.","answer":"The market is full of a number of tools for test management, performance testing, GUI testing, functional testing, etc. I would suggest you opt for a tool which is on-demand, easy to learn as per your skills, generic and effective for the required type of testing.
