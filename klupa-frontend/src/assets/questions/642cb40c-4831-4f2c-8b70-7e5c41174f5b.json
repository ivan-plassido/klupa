[{"question":"What are the Selenium suite components?","answer":"Selenium IDE\r\nIt is a Firefox/Chrome plug-in that was developed to speed up the creation of automation scripts. It records the user actions on the web browser and exports them as a reusable script.\r\n\r\nSelenium Remote Control (RC)\r\nRC is a server that allows users to write application tests in various programming languages. The commands from the test script are accepted by this server and are sent to the browser as Selenium core JavaScript commands. The browser then behaves accordingly.\r\n\r\nSelenium WebDriver\r\nWebDriver is a programming interface that helps create and run test cases. It makes provision to act on web elements. Unlike RC, WebDriver does not require an additional server and interacts natively with the browser applications.\r\n\r\nSelenium Grid\r\nThe grid was designed to distribute commands to different machines simultaneously. It allows the parallel execution of tests on different browsers and different operating systems. It is exceptionally flexible and is integrated with other suite components for simultaneous execution.","_id":"fc5cb33b-e3cb-40b8-8e20-ece4c74914c2","categoryId":"642cb40c-4831-4f2c-8b70-7e5c41174f5b"},{"question":"What are the limitations of Selenium testing?","answer":"1. Unavailability of reliable tech support: Since Selenium is an open-source tool, it does not have dedicated tech support to resolve the user queries. \r\n2.

No built-in reporting and test management facility: Selenium has to be integrated with tools like TestNG, or JUnit among others to facilitate test reporting and management.\r\n5.

Automation testing can help to speed up the process of testing by automating repetitive tasks, such as running the same test cases multiple times or across different browsers.\r\n\r\nAnother big advantage is that automation testing can improve the accuracy of your tests. By automating the process, you can eliminate human error and ensure that your tests are always carried out the same way. This can be particularly important when testing complex applications where there is a greater risk of errors.\r\n\r\nFinally, automation testing can also help to improve the coverage of your tests. By automating more of the testing process, you can increase the number of test cases that are run and cover a larger range of functionality.

In Selenium, assertions are used to verify the state of elements on a page or the results of an action. Assertions can be used to check for the presence or absence of an element, the value of an element, or the text of an element. Assertions can also be used to check that an element is visible or hidden.\r\n\r\nAssertions are an important part of testing with Selenium, as they enable you to verify that the state of your application meets your expectations.

Relative expressions do not start with a forward slash, and are relative to the current context.\r\n\r\nAttributes are another important part of XPath. Attributes are added to elements and can contain valuable information about that element.

This is because, by default, the implicit wait time is set to zero. As such, if an element is not found immediately, your test will keep trying to find it for the duration of the implicit wait time. This can add a significant amount of time to your test suite. Another disadvantage of implicit wait is that it can cause your tests to fail if the element you are waiting for takes longer to appear than the implicit wait time. Finally, implicit wait can make your tests less reliable because they can introduce flakiness.","_id":"c25d8b39-9826-40f9-8d21-4d1b08882cbe","categoryId":"642cb40c-4831-4f2c-8b70-7e5c41174f5b"},{"question":"How can we launch different browsers in Selenium WebDriver?","answer":"We can launch different browsers in Selenium WebDriver using several methods.
